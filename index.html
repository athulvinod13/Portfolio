                    <p>Mark Elliot Zuckerberg ( born May 14, 1984) is an American businessman and philanthropist. He co-founded the social media service Facebook and its parent company Meta Platforms (formerly Facebook, Inc.), of which he is executive chairman, chief executive officer and controlling shareholder.[1][2]

                        Zuckerberg attended Harvard University, where he launched Facebook in February 2004 with his roommates Eduardo Saverin, Andrew McCollum, Dustin Moskovitz and Chris Hughes. Originally launched in only select college campuses, the site expanded rapidly and eventually beyond colleges, reaching one billion users in 2012. Zuckerberg took the company public in May 2012 with majority shares. In 2007, at age 23, he became the world's youngest self-made billionaire. He has since used his funds to organize multiple philanthropic endeavors, including the establishment of the Chan Zuckerberg Initiative.
                        Time named Zuckerberg one of the most influential people in the world in 2008, 2011, 2016 and 2019, and nominated him as a finalist several other times. He was named the Time Person of the Year in 2010, the same year when Facebook eclipsed more than half a billion users.[3][4][5] In December 2016, Zuckerberg was ranked tenth on the Forbes list of the World's Most Powerful People.[6] In the Forbes 400 list of wealthiest Americans in 2023, he was ranked eighth with a personal wealth of $106 billion.[7] As of December 2023, Zuckerberg's net worth was estimated at $115 billion by Forbes, making him the seventh richest person in the world.[8] A film depicting Zuckerberg's early career, legal troubles and initial success with the site, The Social Network, was released in 2010 and won multiple Academy Awards.</p>

                                <p>Zuckerberg is a famous investor, although he's not a fund manager type like Warren Buffett, Ray Dalio, or Carl Icahn. Those guys increased their wealth by learning to pick good companies that already existed. Zuckerberg's path was different. He found his fortune through entrepreneurship -- building a single company from the ground up.</p>
                                <br><br>
                                <p>Zuckerberg's public interviews typically center on Facebook and Meta Platforms rather than his investing style or which stocks to buy. Still, it's possible to glean a sense of his style by looking at the projects he personally funds and the companies he's rolled into his Meta Platforms empire</p>

                                    <p>Zuckerberg's largest investment, by far, is his position in Meta Platforms. He owns about 350 million shares of Meta, which comprise the bulk of his net worth.</p>
                                   <br> <p>Three of Zuckerberg's best investing decisions were made through Meta -- Instagram, WhatsApp, and Oculus. Another good bet was Intercom, which landed in his portfolio by way of Iconiq Capital. Iconiq is a private venture capital firm with Zuckerberg and other billionaires on its client list.</p>

                                        <p>Meta purchased Instagram in 2012 for $1 billion. At the time, the photo-sharing app had 50 million users and no revenue. Since then, the Instagram base has grown to more than one billion users globally. Bloomberg reported that Instagram generated $20 billion in ad revenue for Meta in 2019</p><br>
                                        <p>In 2018, Bloomberg pegged Instagram's stand-alone value at $100 billion. The value increase from $1 billion to $100 billion in six years equates to a compound annual growth rate of 115%</p><br>
                                        <p>Since 2018, Instagram's user base has grown from 805 million (according to Statista) to more than two billion in 2023.</p>

WhatsApp wasn't profitable, but the driver of the deal was the app's momentum. At the time, WhatsApp had 450 million users and was adding one million users daily.</p><br>
                                        <p>User growth has continued. In 2022, Meta reported that WhatsApp had two billion daily active users</p>
